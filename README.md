# CONNJUR_spike
CONNJUR Spike Solutions

The purpose of this repository is to create/document spike solutions for the CONNJUR and NMRbox project.  The goal is that these spikes will be fully functioning prototypes able to be used in their own right, but also templates for future development of CONNJUR tools.
