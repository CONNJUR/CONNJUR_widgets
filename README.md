# CONNJUR_spike
CONNJUR Spike Solutions

The purpose of this repository is to create/document spike solutions for metadata management issues associated with the CONNJUR and NMRbox projects.  The goal is that these spikes will be fully functioning prototypes able to be used in their own right, but also templates for future development of CONNJUR tools. These spikes are designed for use within NMRbox virtual machines.

The first spikes released here are a series of graphical widgets based on the GTK+ library used in the LINUX operating systems used by NMRbox.  This code base is written primarily in C and includes both graphical widgets as well as base code for parsing the various NMR file formats, CONNJUR_ML, and RDF.
